# What are competitive programming contests?

These are contests with problems to test your algorithmic and logical skills. Participating in them is very useful to build a good understanding of data structures and algorithms and also to develop problem solving skills. They are also a lot of fun.

# What language should I use in these contests?

You can use any language of your choice on most platforms. C/C++, Python and Java are the most commonly used languages. Each has its own advantages. C++ and Java are known for being fast and also provide a lot of inbuilt algorithms and ready to use data structures. Python is much more beginner friendly and easy to learn.
